# KittyTunnel
A terminal application that uses pytubefix to create a convenient youtube downloader with some neat extras.

the name was really just inspired by youtube, replacing you with a cat, and tube with a tunnel.

Recommendations:
- I recommend using a vpn while using my tool, as this will generally allow for better online safety.
- I also suggest that when sharing links, you put them into my programm and share the shortened link, as it has youtubes link origin tracking removed.
- If your link wont work, try changing to a different device, location or IP.
-alternatively you can also attempt a different video link with the same content.



Warning:
Note that downloading videos from YouTube without YouTube premium or using the provided in app downloader, is against YouTube guidelines, and may result in your account getting banned.
Also note that downloading copyrighted content against the will of it's creators, using my tool or any other tool alike, is Illegal.

If at any time you do anything with the tooö i provide that is adviced against in the warning section, or in any form against the law, I will not be taking responsibility and my tool will also not be at fault.
